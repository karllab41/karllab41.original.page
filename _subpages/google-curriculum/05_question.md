description: Fifth Question - Machine Learning
---

This is the last machine learning question of the week. We're going to expand on Day 2's question, where you will recall we derived the maximum likelihood estimate of $$\mu$$ and $$\Sigma$$ for the multivariate case. (You should probably derive the maximum a posteriori estimate, also.) 

Now, let's go back to the univariate case, for simplicity's sake. Is the maximum likelihood estimate of the variance a *biased* estimator? Why or why not? If it is not, then how would you determine the *unbiased* estimate of the parameters? What about the multivariate case with a covariance matrix?
