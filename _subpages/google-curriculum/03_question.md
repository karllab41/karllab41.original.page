Given an amount of money, design an algorithm that determines and enumerates all the different ways to come up with change, given all the quarters, nickels, dimes, and pennies in the world. 

For example, say I need to make change for 32 cents. My input is 32 cents, my output is a list of all possible ways to make 32 cents using increments of 25 cents, 10 cents, 5 cents, and 1 cent. You can do this recursively or iteratively. I'd do both for practice, if you have time.
