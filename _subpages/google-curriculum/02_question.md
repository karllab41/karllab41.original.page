Derive the maximum likelihood estimate of the mean and variance of a dataset that is distributed as a Gaussian. So, let the dataset consist of data points $$x_i$$. That is,

{% raw %}
$$ \mathcal{D} = \{ x_1, x_2, x_3, \cdots \} $$
{% endraw %}

where $$x_i \in \mathbb{R}^d$$. What is the maximum likelihood estimate of $$\mu$$ and $$\Sigma$$, provided that

$$x_i \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \Sigma)$$?
