Let’s get on with it. Remember, we’re going to do a mix of three coding questions to two machine learning questions. Order will be randomized. 

__Instructions:__ Simply, a question a day for an hour a day. If you don't finish it, just continue that problem for the next day. *Do not look at the answer at any time until after you solve the problem.* This was difficult for me to do, but ultimately important. 

__Strategy Reminder:__ I would recommend you look over the [strategy section](/blog/2018/google-curriculum/index.html#strategy). Google interviewers aren't looking for you to regurgitate a solution you may have seen before. They're looking to see if you are structured in your approach, disciplined in your implementation, knowledgeable and creative in coming up with different approaches. Doing steps 1-5 in the strategy section will help you through this; I literally wrote out all the steps during my interview. 

Do all of this by pen and paper. Once you've come up with the solution, only THEN do you type it on a computer to see if it works. If it doesn’t work, do not debug on the computer. Debug by hand. Think through by analyzing each case. Do all of this while *verbally* explaining yourself. This all simulates the interview room conditions.
