### Maintaining Strength

Strength training when you have only a day a week to train is difficult. Don't think you can do it? Read a little bit about Kyra Condie, probably one the more accomplished climbers for her age, and check out an X-Ray of her back at age 12. She's now doing V12's.

3. (5min) __Light Bench__ - Start with light plates until you cannot do them
4. (3min) __Neck Exercises__ - Correcting for forward head condition
5. (2min) __Back pulls__ -


You can also put regular text between your rows of images. Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images. You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then.... you reveal it's glory in the next row of images.


<div class="img_row">
    <img class="col two left" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/6.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
    <img class="col one left" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/11.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.

The code is simple. Just add a col class to your image, and another class specifying the width: one, two, or three columns wide. Here's the code for the last row of images above:

<div class="img_row">
    <img class="col two left" src="/img/6.jpg"/>
    <img class="col one left" src="/img/11.jpg"/>
</div>
