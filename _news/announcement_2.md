I am currently considering a position at Google, doing machine learning on the core search team. I'm very excited about joining the team. Since it was a pretty long road getting there, look for some new posts in both vlogs and medium.

Interviewing for engineering positions is quite difficult, and it's nerve racking. I worked with a few friends, and that helped me build a lot of perspective about how to pass the interview process.

#### The Machine Learning Interview Checklist
<ul>
    <li>coding strategy</li>
    <li>coding questions</li>
    <li>machine learning</li>
    <li>system design</li>
</ul>

Each one of these is important in your algorithm design, theoretical understanding, and the underpinnings of the essential Google interview.

One thing I also appreciated was the insider understanding of the process. Google's process, in particular, exceedingly long and bureaucratic. There was a system in place, people had parts to play, and the procedural grind was setup to be long and arduous.

In a few blog posts, I'll detail what to expect when you're interviewing, when you've finished interviewing, and how to negotiate your salary. Admittedly, I didn't do too hot on the last item there, but by the time you've reached that point, there are tons of resources that are reliable on the web.
