Hello! I am a machine learning software engineer at [Google](www.google.com). My current projects are with the Google Search team, ranking suggestions for either your Android or iPhone. My interests are in natural language processing, multi-modal processing, optimization, kernel machines, deep learning, and all the buzzwords. 

Just prior to joining Google, I was the Technical Director of [Lab41](http://www.lab41.org), [In-Q-Tel](http://www.iqt.org), a Menlo Park-based research lab that focuses on big data analytics. Before In-Q-Tel, I kicked off research related to the President's Brain Initiative at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, a Department of Energy Federally Funded Research and Development Center. We focused on electrocortigraphical signals in collaboration with the [Chang Lab](http://changlab.ucsf.edu). Prior to this, I started my post-graduate career at [MIT Lincoln Laboratory](http://www.ll.mit.edu/), which followed a post-doc. I received my doctorate from the University of California, San Diego under the advisement of [Professor Truong Nguyen](https://www.jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/faculty/faculty_bios/index.sfe?fmp_recid=48).

In my spare time, my favorite subreddit to peruse and contribute to are [writing prompts](http://reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts), both for ideas and seeing creativity in action. One of my previous passions was to create [music](/music/), where I'm getting better at the ukulele. I enjoy helping/annoying Amanda and Erik in contributing to the [NYT Crossword Puzzles](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/16/crosswords/daily-puzzle-2018-07-17.html), while being mentored and attempting to complete them. 

My friends and I are trying to keep in touch with old friends by making a video cast called, *Machine Learning at the Movies*, where we talk about movies and teach machine learning concepts inside a window of five minutes per concept.
