"Hurry! Get in!" I shouted at my partner. 

I quickly settled into the cockpit of a large mechanized robot. About forty feet away in the underground hangar, my partner, a uniformed man in a dark green military suit, leapt towards my mech as an alarm started wailing. 

The bay doors cracked open, though I knew that there would be a wall of guards outside it in a convoluted mess of a hallways. I had a map in my head, though, and was optimistic that I could navigate the football field's worth of offices, men with guns, and granite walls between us and the surface. 

A few bullets whizzed by my head and clanged and ricochetted off the bulletproof glass of my still open windshield door, the visor that was my mech's "eyes". My partner managed to climb up and into the cockpit, just as I started the mech's power source. The automated visor slowly whirred down to closed position, and I powered up the weapons system. 

More ricochettes off the mech suit. Our robot turned and dashed towards the hanger doors...*toward the soldiers* that had shot at us.


We'd made it!
