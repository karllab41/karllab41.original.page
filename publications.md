### Community service

I enjoy helping out the computer vision community in whatever capacity they would have me! That's why I've involved myself with IEEE societies. Here are some of the things that I've felt humbled to help out with:

* Technical Reviewer: 
	* Conferences: ICIP, ICASSP, HPEC
	* IEEE Transactions: TSP, TIP, TNN, PAMI
	* Elsevier Journals

- Workshop Organization
	* [Supercomputing 2015](http://ornlcda.github.io/MLHPC2015/programcommittee.html), **ML on HPC** Programming Committee
	* [ACM Multimedia 2015](http://www.mmcommons.org/instigators) **Multimedia Commons** Organizing Committee

* IEEE San Diego Chapter Guest Lecture, November 2015

* IEEE Boston Chapter Secretary, 2009-2012
